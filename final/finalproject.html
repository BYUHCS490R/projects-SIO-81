      <h2>1. Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
      <p>Life and rugby feel very similar to me. Rugby has taught me teamwork, discipline, communication, and how to push through hard times. These lessons helped me grow as a player and as a person. I want to show others how rugby can teach life skills, improve fitness, and help people stay mentally strong. This project lets me combine something I love with important life lessons.</p>
