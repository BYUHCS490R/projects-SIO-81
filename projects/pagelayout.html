                Back home in New Zealand, I always loved going to the beach with my family. The sound of the waves and spending time together made those moments special and full of joy. Visiting the beach was a great way to relax and enjoy each other’s company.

                Now that I’m here, going to the beach feels like a little piece of home. The nearby beaches remind me of those happy times with my family in New Zealand, making every visit comforting and refreshing.
