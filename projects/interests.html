        <p>I love playing sports like basketball, touch, and rugby because they keep me active and challenge me both physically and mentally. Each sport offers a unique experience, but rugby holds a special place since it’s very popular in New Zealand. Playing rugby teaches me teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship, which are important both on and off the field.</p>
        
        <p>Gaming is another hobby I enjoy, as it lets me explore different worlds and test my strategy and reflexes. It’s a fun way to relax and connect with friends online while sharpening my problem-solving skills. The combination of competition and creativity in gaming keeps me engaged and motivated.</p>

            <li><span class="emphasis">Emphasize color:</span> I chose <span class="emphasis">red</span> to draw attention to important text.</li>
            <li><span class="deemphasis">De-emphasize color:</span> I chose <span class="deemphasis">gray</span> to make less important text fade into the background.</li>
            <li>How I chose my colors: I used an online color palette tool to find colors that look good together and ensure readability.</li>
