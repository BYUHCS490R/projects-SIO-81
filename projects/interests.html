            <p>I love playing sports like basketball, touch, and rugby because they keep me active and challenge me both physically and mentally. Each sport offers a unique experience, but rugby holds a special place since it’s very popular in New Zealand. Playing rugby teaches me teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship, which are important both on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>Gaming is another hobby I enjoy, as it lets me explore different worlds and test my strategy and reflexes. It’s a fun way to relax and connect with friends online while sharpening my problem-solving skills. The combination of competition and creativity in gaming keeps me engaged and motivated.</p>
